		<h2>Choosing a University</h2>
		<div id="why">
		<ul>
		 <li class="question"> How long does the application approval take? &#11167;</li>
		 <li class="answer">Application approval takes roughly 10-15 business days after the application deadline.</li><br>
		 <li class="question">What University are Looking for in a Successful Applicant ? &#11167;</li>
		 <li class="answer"> Your GPA in high school shows colleges how successful you were in the field of academics and whether or not you buckled
	   	 down and worked hard. Colleges look not only at your overall GPA but also at how well you did in individual classes. Colleges also 
		 want to see students who stretch themselves beyond the limits of the classroom.The kinds of activities you choose say a lot about your
		 personality and even your morals.</li><br>
		 <li class="question"> Will I get homework like in High School ? &#11167;</li>
		 <li class="answer">Yes, absolutely. You'll be assigned coursework and projects, but unlike high school, no one will be there to hold your
		 hand or tell you off if you fail to submit your homework in time. One of the biggest challenges of university life is finding the rigor 
		 and self-motivation to meet deadlines â€“ very difficult when you are constantly being bombarded with distractions.</li><br>
		 <li class="question"> What if I fail an exam or year ? &#11167;</li>
		 <li class="answer"> If you fail a year, you may get a chance to re-sit your exams, though your marks may be capped at 40%. If you
		 fail again, you would typically have to retake the entire year, drop out or consider switching to a new subject. Failing individual 
		 coursework assignments would probably do no more than hurt your grade average, though in some cases you may be allowed to resubmit.
		 Keep in mind that whatever happens, you should be able to receive counselling and study tips from a student advisor.</li><br>
		 <li class="question"> How many hours of class time a week should I expect ? &#11167;</li>
		 <li class="answer"> Most full-time undergraduate courses in Canada are split across a period of three years.
		 You could expect between 15 and 25 hours of class-time a week, though the exact number will vary a lot
		 depending on your subject and institution.</li><br>
		 <li class="question"> How do I apply for residence ? &#11167;</li>
		 <li class="answer">100% of new semester-one students are accepted to residence if they apply by the deadline. If you are a secondary school
		 student applying for semester one along with your offer of admission, you will be sent instructions on how to complete an application for
		 residence . The application process is completed on-line.  The application must be completed by the published deadline, to guarantee you a
		 space in one of our residence living environments. You will also be required to submit a residence deposit by the same deadline to remain
		 eligible for the housing guarantee. </li><br>
		 <li class="question">  How competitive is the program? What are the chances I'll get into my university of choice ? &#11167;</li>
		 <li class="answer"> Some destinations are more competitive than others simply because there are limited spaces available. Education Abroad
		 strives to send everyone who applies on a program and we work hard to place students in their desired institution/destination. However, due
		 to availability, we cannot always guarantee your first choice. This is why it is important for you to choose your top 3 program carefully.</li><br>
	     <li class="question">	Who is International Orientation for ? &#11167;</li>
		 <li class="answer"> International Orientation is for any first-year student who has a study permit, or attended high school internationally, or is
		 new to Canadian culture, or is developing their English language skills.Your parents and family members can also take part in International 
		 Orientation.</li>
